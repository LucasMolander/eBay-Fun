## eBay Fun
As I was selling some of my old trading cards on eBay, I saw a card listed for
way below the market price. I thought, "A program that could detect underpriced
auctions might be pretty valuable." Thus, this project was born.

The goal is to find the "true" price of a card, find buy-it-now auctions whose
price is significantly below that price, and send a notification to the user.
